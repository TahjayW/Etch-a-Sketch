    -"Container" div to keep the other divs in
    -Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid
    -Keep minimal, uniform size of margins/borders
    -Don't use CSS Grid
>Hover effect so that grid divs change color when mouse passes over them DONE
    -However method? Event listeners
    -Change color through background color or assign a class?

>Button to top of the screen that will send user a popup for # of squares
per side of the new grid

    -Set limit for grid items to be a maximum of 100
